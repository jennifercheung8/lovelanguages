    <h1>An interactive animation that bridges miscommunicated love between me and my Chinese immigrant mother.</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Growing up in a Chinese American household, I always struggled with sharing my feelings with my immigrant parents. Taught to save face and keep emotions in check, my parents and I diverted our feelings into actions rather than words. As I grew up learning to keep my emotions to myself, the distance between my parents and I grew wider and wider.
    <br><br>
    “Love Languages” was created from the desire to better understand my parents and our fluctuating relationship. Using animation and interactive voice overs, the project uncovers how Chinese and American cultural norms can cause expressions of love to get lost in translation. By moving your mouse across the screen as you watch the animation, you’ll be able to hear my mother and myself finally voice our emotional points of view.

    Sending “Love Languages” as a love letter from my family to yours.</p>
